## Spiking Mock up

This is a repo set up in a very similar way to how our project will be set up.

Over two days you will try to complete the issues set out for you in this repo. You are expected to:

- assign yourself issues in the issues tab
- provide updates on your progress by tagging the issue in your commits
  - add a second comment tag to the commit to do this `-m relates #[this should be number of the issue]`
  - write comments in the issue when necessary
- complete ALL issues
- merge your PR's once they are approved

ðŸ‘‰ spike before you code and show me what you learned in the spike
ðŸ‘‰ **ask questions**

ðŸ™… **don't push to main** the branch is not protected and you will lose a lot of time fixing merge conflicts

## Tests

We will talk more about Test Driven Development but for now you need to know this:

There are tests in this repo, and you can run them with these commands:

1. open one terminal window and start your app 
```bash
npm run start
```

2. open a second terminal window and start cypress (that's the test library we are using)
```bash
npx cypress open
```

The tests are all failing, because the app does not exist - your job is to have the tests passing by the end of day 2.

## Finally

Have fun!
